    <h1>Colorado Warms the Night</h1>
    <h2>A Big Idea Project</h2>

</header>
<p>
<h5>During their high school senior seminar, the Bishop Machebeuf graduating seniors of 2016 took part in the Big Idea Project. This project is centered around looking at society and finding a community that they could help. The class was divided into small groups of four and each group picked a project. One group decided on doing the project "Warm the Night." </h5>

<p>
<h4>Warm the Night</h4>

<p> This project was geared towards an overlooked group that is right outside our doors: the homeless population. To help the project become more do-able, the group narrowed down their target market into Colorado's homeless population. This group, as the weather was getting much colder, decided to collect new or gently used scarves and brand new socks to give to the homeless population of Colorado. Throughout the semester, the group asked multiple different communites they were involved in to donate goods or money. Once the goods were collected, the group went and handed out their haul at the Christ in the City Thanksgiving Meal in downtown Denver that year.

<p> The group had a great turn out and was able to meet and go beyond their initial goal for collections. Team "Warm the Night" went on to win their school's competition and become state finalists for the Colorado Big Idea Project. While all of that is fantastic, what is even more so is what the team accomplished. You can check out their entry video below.

<h4>Why does this matter?</h4>
Socks is one of the leading most needed items in homeless shelters and other organizations. Not ony is it nice to put on a pair of fresh socks, wet socks can lead to illness and other unfortunate conditions. By donating a pack of new socks and a scarf, you can help take care of those who may not have the means to take care of themselves. Many say that a society is measured by how they take care of their most vunerable members. As people we all have to take care of one another, especially in this trying times of the pandemic.
