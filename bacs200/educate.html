    <h1>TED and Ed-ucation</h1>
    <p> People learn for all different sources. Books, movies, and newspaper have always been a main staple in the education department. More recently - as in 1984- TED Talks have become a popular option in education and exploring important topics.</p>
    <p>
    <h4>TED Talks ulitize multiple key factors in providing engaging and educational material. </h4>
    <p>These factors include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dynamic Speakers</li>
        <li>Intersting Topics</li>
        <li>Time Effective Presentations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These three keys come together to provide nicely paced packages of great information delivered by inspirational people! Is there a better trifecta? I think not!</p>
    <p>Below I have included a few videos that show why TED Talks have become so popular. </p>

    <p> The amount of times that I have heard people say that they are indecisive is more than I can count. As our consumer market offers more options, people become less able to make a decision. In "How to Make Faster Decisions" we go on a cognitive journey with Patrick McGinnis about what the fear of better options. This episode in <i>The Way We Work</i> TED Talks series we discuss the three different decisions and the best why to handle them. McGinnis presents his points in a clear and concise way that engages his viewers, while still being informative. </p>

    <p>One of my all time favorite type of food is anything to do with pasta! I adore spaghetti. Rigatoni is delightful. And if the dish has Farfalle, or also known as bowtie, noodles I am in love! My dog is even named after a noodle! That being said, I enjoyed "Why Pasta Comes in All Shapes and Sizes" for TED Talks <i>Small Thing, Big Idea</i> series! Paola Antonelli, who is a senior curator at The Museum of Modern Art, takes us on a historical - and tasty- journey of different noodles. Antonelli talks about why each noodle is designed the way it is and its cultrual impact. Recipes were pasted down generationally, which makes since that pasta is considered a comfort food that easily serves big families well. Pasta is not just carbohydrates, it is so much more. </p>

    <h3>"Winners Take All"</h3>
    <p>
    <h5>Anand Giridharadas</h5>
    <iframe width="680" height="380" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3O8fr0e1VGY?list=PL39BF9545D740ECFF" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <p>In this video, Anand Giridharadas delves into winner culture and how it effects society. "Winners Take All" is apart of RSA Animates series called <i>Minimates</i>, which is snack sized videos that cover deep topics. Giridharadas also talks in detail about why society is having such a hard shift away from winner's culture, and it being that many people who have the say did not want it to change. I found this video very education, but also engaging. Giridharadas takes what is basically a huge problem in society and talks about it in great detail, but uses animated graphics to give the viewer a visual protion to his talk. </p>
