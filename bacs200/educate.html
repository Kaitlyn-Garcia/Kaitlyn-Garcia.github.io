<h1>TED and Ed-ucation</h1>
    <p> People learn for all different sources. Books, movies, and newspaper have always been a main staple in the education department. More recently - as in 1984- TED Talks have become a popular option in education and exploring important topics.</p>
    <p><h4>TED Talks ulitize multiple key factors in providing engaging and educational material. </h4>
    <p>These factors include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Dynamic Speakers</li>
    <li>Intersting Topics</li>
    <li>Time Effective Presentations</li></ul>
    <p>These three keys come together to provide nicely paced packages of great information delivered by inspirational people! Is there a better trifecta? I think not!</p>
    <p>Below I have included a few videos that show why TED Talks have become so popular. </p>

    <p>    The amount of times that I have heard people say that they are indecisive is more than I can count. As our consumer market offers more options, people become less able to make a decision. In "How to Make Faster Decisions" we go on a cognitive journey with Patrick McGinnis about what the fear of better options. This episode in <i>The Way We Work</i> TED Talks series we discuss the three different decisions and the best why to handle them. McGinnis presents his points in a clear and concise way that engages his viewers, while still being informative. </p>
