<h3>Log In</h3>
<p>On this page, I learned how to add a login page for a website. This page is pretty important if there is personal accounts that are linked to it. It be most beneficial when the website has messaging, purchasing, or storage components to the website's services. I think that this is a perfect tool to know.</p>

<br>
<h3>Gallery</h3>
<p>On this page, I learned how to add a gallery to a webpage. I think that images really add to any webpage, so it is important to add them to whatever you are creating. I added a sloth page, because they are a main attraction for travel locations. They are absolutely adorable and make me so very happy, so my travel company's mascot is a sloth.</p>

<h3>Icon Bar</h3>
<p>On this page, I learned how to add an icon bar for a website. This page is pretty important since people are very visual creatures. This part allows people to click on links that will lead them to where they need to go, while remaining asthetic and clean. You can fit a lot on an icon bar, so being able to creat one is essential.</p>
<br>
<h3>Register</h3>
<p>On this page, I learned how to add a register page for a website. This page is pretty important if there is for signing up for different things. As more and more appointments and such are signed up for online, it is really important to have a working register section on webpages. </p>
