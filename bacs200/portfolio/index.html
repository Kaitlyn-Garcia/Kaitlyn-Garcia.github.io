<h3>About Me</h3>
<h5>Hello! My name is Kaitlyn Garcia. I am a recent graudate from the University of Northern Colorado with a degree in Business Administration with and empashis in Marketing. I was also able to complete a minor in Art and Design. I was very involved on campus, including with being a Student Ambassador. I was also involved in the Bear Den, Mortar Board Honor Society, and the Entrepreneurial Challenge. Outside of university, I am also very interested in the outdoors. Growing up in Colorado, hiking aand exploring has always been a fun activity. I also really enjoy the arts. I have been drawing and painting since I was little.

<p>
<h5>I like to stay busy. Some of my hobbies involve my adoration for the arts, such as painting and drawing. I have recently started studying photography and woodburning. I also really enjoy knitting, embrodiering, and sewing. I really enjoy baking and I am trying to perfect my from scratch cinnamon roll recipe. When something is not cooking in the oven, I like to write poetry and prose for fun. I also enjoy reading material from others. I have taken up playing Dungeons and Dragons - I really like story telling and world building - aswell as learning how to be a Dungeon Master. </h5>
