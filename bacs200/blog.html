    Towns became bigger and technology more complex. Throughout this time, wars have been fought and plagues have obliterated the population. It only makes sense that time would continue to pass and life would continue to change.

    <p>As the world goes into October of 2020, we are all a little terrified to see what extreme oddity is about to take place. We have seen unyielding fires, political unrest, and - probably the most defining event of 2020 - a national pandemic. The world has been shaken up and, when the dust settled, nothing would be the same. While the pandemic is a national nemisis, it is one that is so excessive that trying to cover the damage in one article is near impossible. That being said, in this particular piece we will be covering the social, economic, and political implications specifically in the state of Colorado.</p>
